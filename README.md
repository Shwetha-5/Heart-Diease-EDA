# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various medical features. The dataset used for this project contains information such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other factors that contribute to the risk of heart disease. We apply machine learning algorithms to create predictive models and analyze the effectiveness of each approach.

### The following algorithms are implemented:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

These models are trained and tested using the dataset, with the goal of accurately predicting whether a person is likely to have heart disease (binary classification: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Heart Disease UCI dataset**, which is a popular dataset for classification tasks. It consists of several medical attributes and the target variable that represents the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **XGBoost**: For the XGBoost model.

**ROC Curve:** 
  A plot that illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
**Feature Importance:** 
  Visualizes the most important features for making predictions using Random Forest and XGBoost models.
